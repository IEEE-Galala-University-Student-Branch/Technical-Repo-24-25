# IEEE AI & ML Training - Session 2: Unstructured Data Pre-processing (Text & Image)

This repository contains materials and notes for **Session 2** of the **IEEE AI & ML Training Program**, focusing on **Text and Image Pre-processing**‚Äîa crucial part of working with unstructured data in machine learning workflows.

## üìå Session Overview

This session was divided into two parts:

### üìù Text Pre-processing
Participants were introduced to foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for preparing raw text data:
- **Regular Expressions** for pattern matching
- **Tokenization** to split text into meaningful units
- **Stop Word Removal** to clean common non-informative words
- **Stemming and Lemmatization** to reduce words to base/root forms
- **Part of Speech (POS) Tagging** to label words grammatically
- **Text Representation** using methods such as:
  - One-Hot Encoding
  - Bag-of-Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF
  - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

### üñºÔ∏è Image Pre-processing
The image section introduced the basics of digital images and common techniques to prepare them for machine learning:
- What is a Digital Image?
- **Basic Image Operations**:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Resizing, Cropping, Rotation
- **Conv2D & Max Pooling** for feature extraction
- **Edge Detection** using gradient-based methods (Sobel, Canny)
- **Image Segmentation** through:
  - Thresholding
  - Clustering (e.g., K-means)
