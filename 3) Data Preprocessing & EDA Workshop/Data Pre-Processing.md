# IEEE AI & ML Training - Session 1: Data Pre-processing in Machine Learning

This repository contains materials and notes for the **first session** of the **IEEE AI & ML Training Program**, focusing on **Data Pre-processing** in Machine Learning.

---

## 📌 Session Overview

In this session, we explored the essential role of **Data Pre-processing** in building accurate and efficient machine learning models. Participants were introduced to key steps including **data cleaning**, **transformation**, **reduction**, **feature extraction**, and **data splitting**. Through real-life examples and hands-on explanations, the session demonstrated how pre-processing improves the quality of raw data and directly impacts model performance.
